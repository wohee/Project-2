    <h3>Founding Principle</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Seoul Women's University has been able to foster knowledge, 
          moral education, and technological education based on Christian spirit in response to the needs of a leader with outstanding technological capabilities in the early days of democratic nation building.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Educational Purpose</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Based on the educational and Christian spirit of the Republic of Korea, the university also acquired the learning and skills to prepare for the information society and the high-level industrial technology society, and developed the education, virtue, and skill to contribute to the development of the nation and human society.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Background of Establishment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Seoul Women's University was founded in 1923 at the 12th general assembly in 1923, which reduced the need for higher education institutions based on the spirit of Christianity.
          The Seoul Women's University was finally opened in April 1961, when it was approved by the School of Justice in July 1958. It was not until 38 years after the nation decided to establish the school after the suffering of the nation.
